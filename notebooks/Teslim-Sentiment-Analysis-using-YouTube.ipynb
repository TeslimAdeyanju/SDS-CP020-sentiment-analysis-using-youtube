An **ETL pipeline** built with **Apache Airflow** automates the extraction, transformation, and storage of the data. The trained model is then deployed using **Streamlit** or **Huggingface Spaces** for easy accessibility.\n",

We need to look at EU standards immigration (on average eu had a lower success rate causing a majority of those who are rejected to move on to us) but then also <br>ACCOMMODATION <br>anyone who comes over without young children basically gets university style accommodation with communal facilities with 1 room per couple or single person, they will attempt to keep families or bonded groups together when they can and it doesn‚Äôt create too much of an issue (ie a 5 room bonded group might not be granted a 6 room accommodation as that can cause issues with the 1 room person, so might be split or put in a 10 room with another bonded group. large families might get a house when it‚Äôs better for the government to do that. However this May roll back to the uni style accommodation under the previous bonded group idea. However if they are a family with young children they may get an apartment or house at the calculation of 1 bedroom per couple and 1 bedroom per 2 children.<br><br>STAY <br>During initial paperwork the paperwork stage to get initial benefits they need to put in the reasons why they left and where they left. If it‚Äôs not a valid reason they then go to court to plead there, an example might be for lgbtq reasons someone from Russia might be allowed, Iceland is told to get a valid visa but America gets argued in court.
